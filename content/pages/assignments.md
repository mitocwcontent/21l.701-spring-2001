Essay Assignment 1
------------------

### Literary Interpretation: Virginia Woolf's Shakespeare

Read one literary text or author whom Woolf discusses in _A Room of One's Own_. Consider why Woolf chooses to include reference to this author's work, and how her representation of the work functions within the overarching "argument" of her essay. After you have made your best efforts to understand the how and why of Woolf's choice, consider how accurate, appropriate, and insightful you find her representation to be.

Make sure to formulate a clear, thoughtful thesis about the relation between texts under discussion; develop and support your thesis using concrete examples; and try to reach a conclusion that might prompt a reader to think further about this matter. Edit your writing to make the sentences lucid, the connections between thoughts felicitous, and the paragraphs useful as indicators of the stages in your argument. An elegant turn of phrase would not be amiss. Double-space the essay, and use standard margins. Proofread your printed essay (do not rely solely on spell-check or on-screen reading) to make sure that it is grammatically correct, clearly organized, and the best, most persuasive presentation of your thinking possible.

Five pages, due Thursday, September 30 in class. Please attend class whether you have finished or not: missing class does not constitute an extension of the deadline.
